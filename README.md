There are so many versions and even these days they cost a few hundred pounds. I need a website that can tell me more about the Turbo Grafx (European Edition) in particular, then I can make a decision to to buy".

#### User Story - Two : Not Sure if these consoles will work in the UK


  * "I'm looking for information on a console a friend showed me years ago, when I was a kid. It's Japanese, so wasn't really available in the UK at the time. I can hopefully find out how to get one that will work in the UK. If I can find a website that tells me about compatibility issues with UK TVs, so I avoid any surprises when I finally buy one".
