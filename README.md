## User Stories

#### User Story - One : Couldn't afford the Turbo Grafx when I was young

  * When I was young, I always wanted a PC engine (Asia version) but couldn't afford one. I heard there are some rare European versions, but I know very little about them. There are so many versions and even these days they cost a few hundred pounds. I need a website that can tell me more about the Turbo Grafx (European Edition) in particular, then I can make a decision to to buy.

#### User Story - Two : Not Sure if these consoles will work in the UK


  * I'm looking for information on a console a friend showed me years ago, when I was a kid. It's Japanese, so wasn't really available in the UK at the time. I can hopefully find out how to get one that will work in the UK. If I can find a website that tells me about compatibility issues with UK TVs, so I avoid any surprises when I finally buy one.

#### User Story - Three: User not sure if his console can play certain games

  * I found one of these consoles in the loft from long ago. Never seen one before, but after a quick a search, I read that they're supposedly good fun. I need to find a website that can tell me the right game type. The games are on cards, not cartridges.

#### User Story - Four: User wants to watch Turbo Grafx content for nostalgia.\

  * "I used to love watching the Turbo Grafx adverts back in the 80s. I need a website where can find some rare content from that time. It would be really funny to see some them again."
