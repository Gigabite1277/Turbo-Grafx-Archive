# Turbo-Grafx-Archive 
An Online Resource For Fans and Collectors of the Rare NEC Turbo Grafx Console (European Edition)

## UX

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to build a web application that informs the user of a retro console from the late 1980s called the Turbo Grafx (European Edition).  This particular version of the console is very rare and has a more unique story compared to itâ€™s Japanese and U.S versions. 

### User Goals
Many sources of information on the Turbo Grafx console seem to be scattered. So with this in mind, having a single point for information will be valuable for anyone wishing seek out one of these rare edition retro consoles. As a collector I can also bring added value and detail to the project.

### Developer Goals
As the developer, I want as many people as possible to gain information regarding this console. That could be for someone who want information before buying off ebay, wanting to see content for nostalgia's sake, or accident when browsing.
