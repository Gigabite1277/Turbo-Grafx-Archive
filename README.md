# Turbo-Grafx-Archive 
An Online Resource For Fans and Collectors of the Rare NEC Turbo Grafx Console (European Edition)


The goal of this project is to build a web application that informs the user of a retro video game console from the late 1980s called the Turbo Grafx (European Edition).  This particular version of the console is very rare and has a more complicated story than itâ€™s Japanese and U.S cousins. Many sources of information on the console seem to be scattered. So with this in mind, having a single all-encompassing point for information will be valuable for anyone wishing seek out one of these rare edition consoles. As a collector I can also bring added value and detail to the project.
