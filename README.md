# Turbo-Grafx-Archive 

An Online Resource For Fans and Collectors of the Rare NEC Turbo Grafx Console (European Edition)
***
## UX

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to build a web application that informs the user of a retro console from the late 1980s called the Turbo Grafx (European Edition).  This particular version of the console is very rare and has a more unique story compared to itâ€™s Japanese and U.S versions.
---
### User Goals
Many sources of information on the Turbo Grafx console seem to be scattered. So with this in mind, having a single point for information will be valuable for anyone wishing seek out one of these rare edition retro consoles. As a collector I can also bring added value and detail to the project.
---
### Developer Goals
As the developer, I want as many people as possible to gain information regarding this console. That could be for someone who want information before buying off ebay, wanting to see content for nostalgia's sake, or accident when browsing.

### User Stories

#### User Story - One :
##### Couldn't afford the Turbo Grafx when I was young

When I was young, I always wanted a PC engine (Asia version) but couldn't afford one. I heard there are some rare European versions, but I know very little about them. There are so many versions and even these days they cost a few hundred pounds. I need a website that can tell me more about the Turbo Grafx (European Edition) in particular, then I can make a decision to to buy.

#### User Story - Two :
##### Not Sure if these consoles will work in the UK

I'm looking for information on a console a friend showed me years ago, when I was a kid. It's Japanese, so wasn't really available in the UK at the time. I can hopefully find out how to get one that will work in the UK. If I can find a website that tells me about compatibility issues with UK TVs, so I avoid any surprises when I finally buy one.
***
#### User Story - Three:
##### User not sure if his console can play certain games.

I found one of these consoles in the loft from long ago. Never seen one before, but after a quick a search, I read that they're supposedly good fun. I need to find a website that can tell me the right game type. The games are on cards, not cartridges.
***
#### User Story - Four:
##### User wants to watch Turbo Grafx content for nostalgia.

"I used to love watching the Turbo Grafx adverts back in the 80s. I need a website where can find some rare content from that time. It would be really funny to see some them again."
