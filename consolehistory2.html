The PC-Engine was a collaboration of two Japanese companies, Hudson Soft who managed the console design and a branch of the globally recognised NEC corporation, this instance the Home Electronics branch of NEC. The console was marketed as a 16bit console at the time boasting and 8 bit CPU and a 16bit graphics processor.
